## C# to JavaScript compiler, now on .NET Core 3.1 

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/curiosity-ai/mosaik/_apis/build/status/h5-compiler?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/curiosity-ai/mosaik/_build/latest?definitionId=38&branchName=master)

This repository contains our experimental fork of the original [Bridge](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/bridge) C# to Javascript compiler.

The key goal with this fork is to bring it closer to the C# .NET Core 3.1 / .NET Standard world, and experiment with new ideas for supporting a more integrated development experience (such as the awesome new [C# Source Generators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/)).

##  Getting Started âš¡

This new compiler build is fully based on [netstandard2.0](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/h5/blob/master/H5/H5/H5.csproj) & [netcore3.1](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/h5/blob/master/H5/Compiler/Builder/H5.Builder.csproj), and removes all dependencies on the legacy .NET Framework.

To get started with it, you can use the following project template  

````xml
<Project Sdk="h5.Target/0.0.7789">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="h5" Version="*" />
    <PackageReference Include="h5.Core" Version="*" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
````

The Sdk target above (``<Project Sdk="h5.Target/0.0.7789">``) will automatically install (and update) the compiler as a ``dotnet global tool``. You can also manually install it with:

````bash
dotnet tool update --global h5-compiler
````




> Don't forget to run ``dotnet restore`` to fill the versions with the latest values.

We'll very soon add a `dotnet new` template supporting h5.

##  Breaking Changes ðŸ’¥

This fork introduces a series of breaking changes as part of the modernization effort. 
- *H5* projects must target ``netstandard2.0``.
- The compiler will drop support to the legacy *.csproj* format.
- The compiler will not be distributed anymore as part the library NuGet package, and will instead be instaled as a ``dotnet global`` tool.
- Retyped packages are not supported (as those are maintained by the Bridge authors, and cannot be built separately or consumed without Bridge).

Other breaking changes will be introduced with the goal of supporting:
- Full multiplatform (Windows, Linux & MacOS) compilation without any need for Mono.
- Compiler-as-a-service mode - similar to how [Rosyln](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) can be hosted in process.

##  Update Notes ðŸ“‘

To avoid any conflicts with the original Bridge compiler, we've renamed the base library and compiler, and they're distributed completely separated from the Bridge/Retyped packages.

The currently available NuGet packages are:
- [H5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/h5/) (replaces the base [Bridge](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bridge/) library) 
- [H5.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/h5.core) (replaces [Retyped.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Retyped.Core/), [Retyped.es5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Retyped.es5/) and [Retyped.dom](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Retyped.dom/))
- [H5.Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/h5.Newtonsoft.Json/) (replaces [Bridge.Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bridge.Newtonsoft.Json/))

Other packages might be added in the future.
